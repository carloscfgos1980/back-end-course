## Augmenting the ON Criteria
The ON clause generated by the relationship() construct may also be augmented with additional criteria. This is useful both for quick ways to limit the scope of a particular join over a relationship path, and also for use cases like configuring loader strategies, introduced below at Loader Strategies. The PropComparator.and_() method accepts a series of SQL expressions positionally that will be joined to the ON clause of the JOIN via AND. For example if we wanted to JOIN from User to Address but also limit the ON criteria to only certain email addresses:

>>> stmt = select(User.fullname).join(
...     User.addresses.and_(Address.email_address == "pearl.krabs@gmail.com")
... )
>>> session.execute(stmt).all()
SELECT user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
JOIN address ON user_account.id = address.user_id AND address.email_address = ?
[...] ('pearl.krabs@gmail.com',)
[('Pearl Krabs',)]
