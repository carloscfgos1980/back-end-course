## Autogenerated primary key attributes
Once the rows are inserted, the two Python objects we’ve created are in a state known as persistent, where they are associated with the Session object in which they were added or loaded, and feature lots of other behaviors that will be covered later.

Another effect of the INSERT that occurred was that the ORM has retrieved the new primary key identifiers for each new object; internally it normally uses the same CursorResult.inserted_primary_key accessor we introduced previously. The squidward and krabs objects now have these new primary key identifiers associated with them and we can view them by acesssing the id attribute:

>>> squidward.id
4
>>> krabs.id
5

Tip

Why did the ORM emit two separate INSERT statements when it could have used executemany? As we’ll see in the next section, the Session when flushing objects always needs to know the primary key of newly inserted objects. If a feature such as SQLite’s autoincrement is used (other examples include PostgreSQL IDENTITY or SERIAL, using sequences, etc.), the CursorResult.inserted_primary_key feature usually requires that each INSERT is emitted one row at a time. If we had provided values for the primary keys ahead of time, the ORM would have been able to optimize the operation better. Some database backends such as psycopg2 can also INSERT many rows at once while still being able to retrieve the primary key values.
